## Adaptive bandwidth kernel density estimation

Code for Adaptive bandwidth kernel density estimation for next-generation sequencing data

### Citation
This repo contains software accompanying the publication ["Adaptive bandwidth kernel density estimation for next-generation sequencing data"](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1753-6561-7-s7-s7), _BMC Proceedings,_ 2013.

Please cite the above publication if you use the described algorithm or this software.

This repo includes a Matlab implementation (MainKDE.m) and an R implementation (AKDESeq.R) with code implementing the adaptive bandwidth kernel density estimation schemes described in the above publication. Usage instructions can be found in comments at the top of each file. The Matlab code is more polished, has some extra features, and is faster. However, if you are not a Matlab user, the R version implements the main algorithm equally well. Both codes are free for non-commercial use.
